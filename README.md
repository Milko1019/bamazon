Customer View


Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

Look in image folder to see how it works.
